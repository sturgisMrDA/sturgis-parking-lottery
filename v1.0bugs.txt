Two syntax errors (missing colon and over-indented elif).
importToArray is never called: should be called in validate() and result assigned to 'data' before calling emailValidation().
emailValidation() doesn't return anything [yet its value is assigned to data in validate()]
emailValidation needs to convert email list back to 2D array

emailValidation needed tons of work!  ugh.


def findGrade() needs
 some arguments
in findGrade(), type conversion issues

line 248: if i.ischeater == True:  reverse i, index in enumerate line
